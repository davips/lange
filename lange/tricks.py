def detect_precision(x, maxdigits=28):
    """
    Detect the precision (include digits before and after the decimal separator).

    The checking only works if 'max_digits' is large enough.

    Usage:
        >>> detect_precision(3)
        1
        >>> detect_precision(3.7)
        2
        >>> detect_precision(3.0)
        1
        >>> detect_precision(30.0e-4)
        4
        >>> detect_precision(30.0e4)
        6
